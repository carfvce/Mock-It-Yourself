# UCEED/Ceed Score Tracker

This project is a fork of [Mock-It-Yourself repository](https://github.com/krishiv1545/Mock-It-Yourself/) to help UCEED (Undergraduate Common Entrance Examination for Design) aspirants track their mock test scores and performance. It offers an easy-to-use web-based tool to track the scores from different sections like **NAT**, **MSQ**, and **MCQ**, based on the user's input for correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions.

The tool allows you to:
- Input your scores for each section.
- Save and view the score data.
- Track and calculate accuracy and total scores.

### How to Use:

1. **Input the Scoring Rules**:
   - Set the marks for correct and incorrect answers for each section (NAT, MCQ).
   - MSQ has partial marking as of recent years so choose marks as applicable.
   - Accuracy is calculated based on correct attempted questions (ie +1 in msq and +4 in msq have same impact on accuracy)

2. **Track Your Progress**:
   - For each section (NAT, MCQ), use the buttons to mark questions as correct, incorrect, or not attempted.
   - The tool will update your scores and accuracy in real-time.

3. **Save and View Scores**:
   - Click "Save Scores" to save your progress, and the scores will be added to a table below, with details such as date, section, correct, incorrect, left, accuracy, and total score.

### Acknowledgements:

- This project format and styling are shamelessly copied from the [Mock-It-Yourself repository](https://github.com/krishiv1545/Mock-It-Yourself/) created for tracking JEE mock test scores. The functionality and structure were adapted for UCEED/CEED aspirants to track their mock test performance more effectively. 
- ChatGpt was used in making this readme file.
- **Important for UCEED/CEED aspirants**: Since previous years' questions (PYQs) are typically available only in PDF format, this tool can be a useful resource for tracking your mock test attempts and improving your accuracy over time.
- Light Nord theme is used
