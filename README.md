# Mock-It-Yourself
Calculate and track your JEE mock scores.

Just press +4, -1 or Did Not Attempt as you go solving your mock Question Papers. MockItYourself will count the total times you've pressed either of this button, will show you your current score and give you an evaluation out of 300 (JEE paperstyle) after you press on the Calculate button.

Accidentally refreshed? No worries! The scores and Press-counter values are both stored in localStorage that prevents the loss of data.
